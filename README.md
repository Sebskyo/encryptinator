Encryptinatorâ„¢:
A really bad implementation of RSA in Java
Disclaimer: it is actually bad due to too low primes

===||===

What this is
	A school project of implementing two different prime generating algorithms, although fuck that I want to implement the whole shebang.

Why its behaviour is shit
	Simply running the program will (in the future) just result in a comparison between the two algorithms, and you'll have to do workarounds to actually generate keys and en/de -crypt.
	I will although at some point in late 2015/early 2016 modify the program to make it more intuitive and actually usable by sensible human beings.

How to use
	TBD :^)
